# code-practice-helper
A simple autograder (in Kotlin) that allows testing of student Java/Kotlin code generally, and gives the student tips about what their solution should look like (looks for methods, parameters/types, and return type, as well as test cases). Suggestions/improvements/corrections/comments/concerns all welcome!
